# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

ATTENTION:
Repository folder has to be called "dotfiles" to ensure that everything works as intended.

## Load dotfiles dir into a systems' home dir under ~/dotfiles
`git clone git@github.com:Jojotyp/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`

Run `bash install.sh` in the terminal to overwrite existing dotfiles in ~ for custom settings.
This can create backups of old dotfiles.

## Add a new dotfile
- create the dotfile
- add its name in install.sh

## hints repo for information on all aspects of development and on installing other projects
`git clone git@github.com:Jojotyp/hints.git ~/Programming/hints`
