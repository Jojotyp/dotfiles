# Prompts (source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bash/Prompt_customization)
# PS0 is displayed after each command, before any output.
# PS1 is the primary prompt which is displayed before each command, thus it is the one most people customize.
# PS2 is the secondary prompt displayed when a command needs more input (e.g. a multi-line command).
# PS3 is not very commonly used. It is the prompt displayed for Bash's select built-in which displays interactive menus.
# Unlike the other prompts, it does not expand Bash escape sequences. Usually you would customize it in the script where
# the select is used rather than in your .bashrc.
# PS4 is also not commonly used. It is displayed when debugging bash scripts to indicate levels of indirection.
# The first character is repeated to indicate deeper levels.
